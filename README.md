# Unsupervised Clustering 

## Purpose

The Unsupervised Clustering Solution project aims to identify natural groupings within a dataset without prior knowledge of the labels. This project explores various clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to discover patterns or groupings within the data. The goal is to segment the data into clusters that share similar characteristics, which can be useful for tasks like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and more.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Unsupervised_Clustering_Solution.git
cd Unsupervised_Clustering_Solution

Install the Dependencies:
Ensure that Python is installed on your system (preferably version 3.7 or above). Install the required Python libraries by running:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Data:
Make sure your dataset is available and correctly formatted. If necessary, modify the data_loader.py script to load and preprocess your data.

Run the Main Script:
Execute the main script to perform clustering on the dataset:

sh

python unsupervised_clustering_solution/main.py

View Results:
The script will output cluster assignments and may generate visualizations to help you understand the cluster structure within the data. Analyze these results to draw insights or further refine the clustering process.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several Python libraries, which are specified in the requirements.txt file. Key dependencies include:

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    numpy: For numerical operations and handling array data.
    scikit-learn: For implementing various clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics.
    matplotlib: For visualizing the clustering results.
    seaborn: For advanced data visualization.

To install the dependencies, use the command:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
